# apple-shortcuts
This my collection of useful shortcuts I made from scratch in the shortcuts app. Feel free to use them yourself!
Edit the titles, icons, and add them to wherever you find them most useful.
iOS18 allows you to add shortcuts to your control center and home screen, which I absolutely love. 
On MacOS15, these can be added to your Menu Bar, the Dock, as a Widget, or with a keyboard shortcut.

## Automatically start directions to your next event when connecting to CarPlay: Titled 'Year 3000 GPS'
When automated this shortcut does not need to be added anywhere to work correctly.
### Uses the maps app & calendar app, to be integrated in vehicles with Apple CarPlay

## Send An Email To Yourself: Titled 'Note To Self'

##### Edit in the shortcuts app:
- Select desired contact by clicking 'Recepient'. I use my own contact.
- Subject title is set to 'You Got Mail'. Edit this to whatever you'd like.

## Open a Popup to Search Google: Titled 'I'm Feeling Lucky'
### Uses the Safari app. 
- Note: This shortcut can also work with the Google Chrome app for iPhone and iPad. Unfortunately, there is no Google Chrome app on the Mac App Store so it will not work on Mac.
### Pinned to the Mac Menu Bar. Also a great shortcut to add to your control center on iPhone and iPad.

## Shortcuts I use to track my water consumption. There is currently no Health app on Mac, so these only work on iPhone and iPad. (im)Patiently waiting for Mac integration. I use 3 shortcuts that work with each other. Add them to your shortcuts in this order for easiest integration.
## 1. Notification to display when you've met your daily water goal: Titled 'Water Goal Met'
#### Copy Link: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7056b9be2ad0405ab734f0de97192520]
##### Edit in the shortcuts app:
- Select the dropdown arrow to customize the notification text. It displays as the shortcut title in bold, with the text 'Hydrated as hell? Thats you' underneath. This can be changed to whatever you'd like.
## 2. Log Water in mL: Titled 'Log Water'
#### Copy Link: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fd23b04af2124decab60bbc673a2a844]
##### Edit in the shortcuts app:
- In 'List', you can add a list of mL. I have several water bottles that I routinely am refilling so I use the sizes of my bottles. You can edit the amounts, remove, or add options.
- Under 'Calculate the [Sum] of [Health Samples], it says [3000]. Edit this to your own water consumption goal, I know a lot of people don't think you need 3000 mL a day. Meh, I disagree, but do you, folks!
## 3. Automatically delete your water files at the end of the week. Titled: 'Delete Water Files'
- I personally hate having tons of data in my phone storage that I don't need. I only care about my water consumption for that day, so this deletes all my data at the end of the week for me.
#### Copy Link: [https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5c2daca641b54cd487eecee376385d3b]
##### How To Automate:
- Create New Automation
- Do Not Notify When Run
- WHEN: at your desired time and day. Mine is set to 10 PM, Sunday
- DO: Delete Water Files
